# Java Selenium Framework

Welcome to the Java Selenium Framework repository! This framework is designed to simplify automated testing using Selenium WebDriver in Java, focusing on readability, organization, and report generation.

## Features

- **Easy to Understand**: The framework is built with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for developers of all levels to write and maintain tests.
  
- **Well Organized**: The codebase is structured into logical modules and components, following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
  
- **Well Written**: Clean and concise code ensures readability and reduces the complexity of test scripts.
  
- **HTML Reports**: Generates detailed HTML reports that provide clear insights into test execution results, helping to identify issues quickly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Java Selenium Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured on your system.
  
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   git clone (https://github.com/JaiChandwani/SeleniumFramework.git)

3. **Setup**: Configure your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) to import the project as a Maven project.

4. **Dependencies**: Maven will automatically download the required dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file.

5. **Run Tests**: Use your IDE to run the sample test cases provided in the `src/test/java` directory.

## Usage

The framework provides a set of utilities and helpers to assist you in writing and executing Selenium tests. Here are a few key components:

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates web pages and their elements, promoting reusability and maintenance.

- **TestNG Integration**: Utilizes TestNG for test execution and management, leveraging its annotations for setup, teardown, and test case grouping.

- **Reporting**: After test execution, detailed HTML reports are generated in the `target/surefire-reports` directory.
